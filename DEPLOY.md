# How to Share Your Valentine Website

## Option 1: View Locally (Test it first!)
1. Double-click the `index.html` file on your computer.
2. The website should open in your browser.
3. Try adding `?name=YourName` to the end of the URL in the address bar (e.g., `file:///.../index.html?name=Nirali`) and press Enter to see the custom name.

## How to Share Your Link (GitHub Pages)

Since you have already pushed your code to GitHub, follow these final steps:

1.  **Go to your Repository Settings**:
    - Open your repository page on GitHub: [https://github.com/ThePunisher0/Just-For-Fun](https://github.com/ThePunisher0/Just-For-Fun)
    - Click on the **Settings** tab (top right of the repo menu).

2.  **Enable GitHub Pages**:
    - On the left sidebar, click **Pages** (under the "Code and automation" section).
    - Under **Build and deployment** > **Branch**, click the dropdown that says "None".
    - Select **master**.
    - Click **Save**.

3.  **Get Your Link**:
    - Refresh the page after about 1-2 minutes.
    - You will see a banner at the top saying "Your site is live at..."
    - The link will likely be: `https://ThePunisher0.github.io/Click_to_get_Suprise/`

4.  **Share It**:
    - Add `?name=Nirali` to the end.
    - **Final Link**: `https://ThePunisher0.github.io/Click_to_get_Suprise/?name=Nirali`
